# p4nd0r4s
p4nd0r4s can scan any internet-facing host system of any organization's infrastructure for a particular domain. Its user-friendly interface enables a user to enter the domain to know about the technology stack that any organization's infrastructure uses. In contrast to Pandora's Box, which released several curses, p4nd0r4s' purpose is to locate any open ports and misconfigured outdated services in reference to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures so that they get rectified before the "curse" takes its toll.

This project is assigned to us by Cyberlabs(Infosec division). We, the team of three, Ankur Roy, Kappala Akshay, and Pasunooti Uday Ashish, worked under the guidance of our mentors, especially Uddagiri Jithendra Nadh sir.
